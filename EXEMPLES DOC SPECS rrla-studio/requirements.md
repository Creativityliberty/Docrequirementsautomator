# Requirements Document

## Introduction

RRLA Studio 2.0 est une plateforme moderne et intuitive pour créer, gérer et surveiller des Reinforcement Reasoning Learning Agents (RRLA). Le studio fournit un environnement complet permettant aux développeurs de concevoir, tester et déployer des agents intelligents capables d'améliorer leurs capacités de raisonnement et d'exécution de code grâce à l'expérience et au feedback. RRLA Studio 2.0 introduit la boucle R²-Loop (Retrieve → Reason → Reflect → Refine → Report) pour des agents vraiment raisonneurs et "evidence-based", s'intègre avec l'architecture PocketFlow existante et exploite le MCP (Model Context Protocol) pour créer un environnement de développement puissant pour les agents IA.
